# Intro

We are building a Legal Services Marketplace. Let's call it Captain Contrat :)

Here is our plan:
- let any lawyer offer its services on our platform
- let any person (let's call her 'entrepreneur') order a service


# Level 1

Captain Contrat offers legal services at an initial fixed rate. The contractor then chose a service and must pay the `document` price before the order is transmitted to the lawyer.

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`

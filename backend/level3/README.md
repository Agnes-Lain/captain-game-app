# Level 3

The lawyer now wants his money.
We decide to take a fees based on the `service_price` to cover our costs and have a solid business model.
In the case of a reduction, its is applied to the Captain Contrat service fee.

The payment work like this:
  1. The money is taken from the client bank account and stored in an order wallet
  2. The money goes to the lawyer wallet when the order is completed
  3. And then a service fees is sent to Captain Contrat wallet

Compute the amount collected from the customer, the part that belongs to the lawyer and to us.

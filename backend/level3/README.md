# Level 3

The lawyer now wants his money.
We decide to take a fee based on the `service_fee` to cover our costs and have a solid business model.
In the case of a reduction, its is applied to the Captain Contrat service fee.

The payment work like this:
  1. The money is taken from the `client bank account` and stored in an `order wallet`
  2. The money goes to the `lawyer wallet` when the order is completed
  3. And then a service fee is sent to `Captain Contrat wallet` from the `lawyer wallet`

Compute the amount collected from the customer, the part that belongs to the lawyer and to us.
